We are a group of people interested in automation, infrastructure, software development processes and networking.
We speak everything that is cloud native, defined as code and automated.
We run this blog and a YouTube channel to share our interests and ideas.
We currently publish most of our content in Polish. However there are a few places where you can find our talks in English:
- (upcoming) [Hacking on Network Service Mesh Dataplane for a True Multi-cloud Experience](https://sched.co/Zepf) by Ola and Jarek
- [From Here to Eternity: How 12 Factor Apps Can Help You Get There with Your Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY1wEPHjPJY) by Wojtek
